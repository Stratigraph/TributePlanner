	abstract = {{"Robert} Axelrod's extraordinary book, The Evolution of Cooperation was globally acclaimed for the rich results of its simple model. The Complexity of Cooperation now gathers together the myriad fruits of more than a decade's work, carefully 'complexifying' his initial model. Like his ideas, his prose is clear and engaging. His delight as he unveils each surprising discovery is infectious. This book is not merely important; it's fun."--Robert D. Putnam, author of Making Democracy {WorkRobert} Axelrod is widely known for his groundbreaking work in game theory and complexity theory. He is a leader in applying computer modeling to social science problems. His book The Evolution of Cooperation has been hailed as a seminal contribution and has been translated into eight languages since its initial publication. The Complexity of Cooperation is a sequel to that landmark book. It collects seven essays, originally published in a broad range of journals, and adds an extensive new introduction to the collection, along with new prefaces to each essay and a useful new appendix of additional resources. Written in Axelrod's acclaimed, accessible style, this collection serves as an introductory text on complexity theory and computer modeling in the social sciences and as an overview of the current state of the art in the {field.The} articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction betweenindividuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of the social system. The Complexity of Cooperation is essential reading for all social scientists who are interested in issues of cooperation and complexity},

	abstract = {This study investigated the impact of the micro-level factors on the pattern of the system-level properties in international relations, and the impact of dyadic and systemic factors on the probability of war. Considering that existing simulation models in international relations have focused on the conflict dimension, this study tried to integrate the cooperative dimension of world politics in order to see what would happen in the integrated model. Computer simulations, using the cellular automata framework and the complex systems theory, were designed to generate artificial datasets for testing the nine propositions related to major international relations theories.
Three major tasks were undertaken in this study. First, a replicated model of security-only world was compared to a newly integrated model of the security-and-trade world on three dependent variables--system endurance, balance-of-power, and state survival rate. The introduction of trade into the model made system endurance more probable than the security-only world. The probability of deterrent balance-of-power increased in the security-and-trade world, while there was little difference in defensive balance-of-power. State survival rate increased with the trade module, but system-level factors had more impact than state-level factors in the security-and-trade world.
Second, the integrated model of war and trade was also used to test the relationship between dyadic factors--economic interdependence and heterogeneity--to the probability of war. In this cellular automata world, the increase of economic interdependence reduced the probability of war. The type of dyads, measured by the heterogeneity in state power, had a great impact on the probability of war, too. Wars happened the most frequently in the minor-minor dyad, while major states were more prudent in starting war.
The third task concerned the impact of systemic factors--polarity and power concentration--on the probability of war. Multipolar worlds were the most war-prone, while unipolar worlds were the least. A similar result appeared with the number of major powers, instead polarity, as the explanatory variable. Also the power concentration among major powers was found to show an inverted U-shaped curve with the probability of war lowest when the number of great powers was two or three.},

	abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays,, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon, (popularly known as six degrees of separation). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},
